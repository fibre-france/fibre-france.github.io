## Overview

The OptoDAS from Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) leverages advanced distributed acoustic sensing technology to transform standard optical fibers into thousands of virtual microphones. This enables continuous, real-time monitoring of submarine cable infrastructure, providing actionable insights for asset protection and operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **High Sensitivity:** Detects minute acoustic and vibrational events along the entire cable length.
- **Long-Range Monitoring:** Covers distances up to 100 km per unit, scalable for extended networks.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Immediate event detection and localization with intuitive visualization tools.
- **Non-Intrusive:** Utilizes existing optical fibers without impacting data transmission.
- **Robust & Reliable:** Designed for harsh marine environments and long-term deployment.
- **Seamless Integration:** Compatible with ASNâ€™s submarine cable systems and third-party infrastructure.
